##  **What is This**

It all starts with my adventures looking for remote jobs or maybe some on-site jobs that have relocation benefit from my current country (Indonesia) to Europe (yes, i know it's friggin far away, well man can dream) because of some personal circumstances. after some times, I found out that my chances are super slim the way it is. So i figure out that i need to show up some skills and achievement to increase the odds a little bit even called for interview is massive boost. HOWEVER, all of my current and previous works are super sensitive data and any work upon that is highly classified thus i cannot easily share it. So there it is for the quick history.
